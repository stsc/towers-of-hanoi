towers-of-hanoi
===============
A simple web-based "towers of hanoi"[1] implementation (written
in HTML/CSS and JavaScript).

The count of rods and disks is fixed, hence this implementation
probably serves best as an entry point to the whole thematic area.
With regards to the optimum of moves, 15 are required at most.
