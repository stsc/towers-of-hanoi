towers-of-hanoi
===============
A simple web-based "towers of hanoi"[1] implementation (written
in HTML/CSS and JavaScript).  This implementation uses script.aculo.us[2]
under the hood to make basic drag & drop happen.

The count of rods and disks is fixed, hence this implementation
probably serves best as an entry point to the whole thematic area.
With regards to the optimum of moves, 15 are required at most.

Caveat: this implementation does not work on devices when a touch
screen is being used (due to different events being triggered).
